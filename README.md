## üå†`What is Victoria?`

In `v2`, `v3`, `v4`, Victoria was a Lavalink wrapper which was simple as Sharplink and code style was similar to DSharpPlus.Lavalink.
Now Victoria is divided in 4 projects and each packages offers something different which is explained below:

- ‚öú `Victoria.Addon`: Contains any extensions or helper classes for Lavalink & Frostbyte. All extension in `v4` are now in Addon package.
- üß† `Victoria.Common`: Provides the base classes for track/client/websocket/etc. Lavalink & Frostbyte package depend on Common.
- ‚ùÑ `Victoria.Frostbyte`: Serves as an example Client implementation for Frostbyte and also keeps up with any Frostbyte changes.
- üåã `Victoria.Lavalink`: Originally known as `Victoria` only. Library for interacting with Lavalink server.

On `Nuget` you will see 5 packages: `Victoria.XYZ` and `Victoria` which contains all the packages above. Each package has it's own `README.md` file provides example usage.
The main package `Victoria`'s version will keep incrementing whereas rest of the packages `Victoria.XYZ` will start from version `1.x.x`.
